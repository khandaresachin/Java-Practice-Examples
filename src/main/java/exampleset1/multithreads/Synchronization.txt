Synchronization:
    Java Synchronization is used to make sure by some synchronization method that only one thread
    can access the resource at a given point in time.

    It is capable of controlling access to multiple threads to a particular shared resource.
    The main reason for using thread synchronization are:
        - To prevent the interference between threads
        - To prevent the problem of consistency

    Types of Synchronization:
        1) Process Synchronization
        2) Thread Synchronization

    Process Synchronization is done at the Operating System level

    Thread Synchronization is something we are going to work on in Java:

        1) Mutual
            - Synchronized Method
            - Synchronized Block
            - Static Synchronization


    General form of synchronized block:
        //only one thread can execute at a time
        //sync_object is a reference to an object
        //whose lock associates with monitor
        //the code is said to be synchronized on the monitor object
        synchronized(sync_object){
            // access shared variable and other
            // shared resource
        }
